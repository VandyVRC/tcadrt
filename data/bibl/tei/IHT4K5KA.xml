Working in and around the cosmopolitan world of court-sponsored Buddhism in both Chang’an and Luoyang, Woncheuk was strongly influenced by Tathāgatagarbha thought, and his interpretation of Yogācāra Buddhism ultimately became very influential in Tibet and Korea. By placing the pagoda in the context of Woncheuk’s thought, as well as recent research on amulets, architecture, and other thaumaturgical devices in the early medieval ritual praxis of South Asia and North China, I argue that Woncheuk’s equation of ta to fen suggests the monuments had more than a memorial or symbolic function. Rather his “Preface” reflects a belief that the two types of architecture were operating on the same technological principles—they were both designed as tools to channel natural, even cosmic, energies through “mountains” and into powerful remains in order to aid in personal and societal salvation.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
