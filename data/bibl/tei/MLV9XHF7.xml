The subjects of research are the 9 buildings shown in Table 1. The "Sashihijik" of the Jusimpo style architecture in Korea is different from that of China and Japan. The "Sashihjiki" of the Jusimpo style architecture is not the orthodox "Sashihijiki" that is inserted into the column, but the fitted in the top of the column. .In addition, there were two types of "Sashihijiki" in the Jusimpo style architecture in the Goryeo era. One is a "Sashihijiki" that reinforce the structure and the other is a simple "Sashihijiki" fitted at the top of column. The former is found at Sudeoksa Daeungjeon (Fig. 1), Seongbulsa Geugnakjeon(Fig. 2), and so on, and the latter is found at Buseoksa Josadang(Fig. 3), Gangneung Gaeksamun(Fig. 4), and so on. They have different geographical distributions(Fig. 7). Buildings with the "Sashihijiki" that reinforce the structure are located in the area near the center of Goryeo Dynasty -namely Gaeseong or Ganghwa, and the buildings with the "Sashihijiki" symply fitted at the top of column are located in the area away from the center. This shows the process of popularization of "Sashihijiki", the old form remains in the areas far from the center, and the more developed "Sashihijiki" spread in the near the center. And it shows the process of development of "Sashihijiki". That is, it changed from a simple "Sashihijiki" fitted at the top of the column to a "Sashihijiki" that reinforce the structure. The change to the "Sashihijiki" that reinforce the structure mentioned above was made independently in the Jusimpo style architecture at the Goryeo era. In addition, it is possible that the "Sashihijiki" that was simply fitted in the top of the column also created in Korea. On the other hand, such "Sashihijiki" that is simply fitted in the top of the column is also found in Chinese and Japanese architecture related to Fujian architecture. It is buildings in Kaiyuansi(Fig. 10) at Fujian of China and buildings related to Daibutsuyo style architecture(Fig. 11) in Japan. It considers that such a "Sashihijiki" is a modification of the orthodox "Sashihijiki". Therefore, it is unlikely that such “Sashihijiki” was created independently in Korea at the same time as China and Japan. In addition, there is a high possibility that the orthodox "Sashihijiki" inserted into the column was known in Goryeo through Southern Song. In the painting of Goryeo, Ajipdo Daeryeon(Fig. 13), the orthodox "Sashihijiki" brought from the Southern Song is drawn. And "Sashihijiki" of Eunhaesa Gojoan Yeongsanjeon (Fig. 5) is double-layered, and there is posibility that the below one is a trace of the orthodoxl "Sashihijiki" that inserted into the column. That is, there is high possibility that Fujian architecture of China was known in Korea. Theerfore it is considered that under the influence of Fujian architecture from Southern Song "Sashihijiki" was made in Goryeo. And then "Sashihijiki" has developed and spread independently in the Jusimpo style architecture of Goryeo.</note></biblStruct><bibl type="formatted" subtype="bibliography" resp="https://www.zotero.org/styles/chicago-note-bibliography-17th-edition">
